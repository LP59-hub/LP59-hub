- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LP59-hub
I have no programing skills but landed here trying to install Free Sidecar.
I followed all instructions, everything run smooth, included the last for Catalina 10.15.4+ users, but I still don't have any Sidecar icon in my System preferences.
I have an iMac14,2 on Catalina 10.15.7
Do you know how I should investigate to make it work?
Best Regards
